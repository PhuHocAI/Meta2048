## Implementation approach

We will build the 2048 game using Python along with the Pygame library for handling graphics and user interactions. Pygame is well-suited for creating simple games like 2048 with a responsive UI. We'll design the game to provide a classic 2048 experience but with flexible grid sizes and additional features like undo and high score tracking. The UI will be visually appealing and responsive for both desktop and mobile screens, utilizing adaptive design techniques.

- game.py

- score_manager.py

## Data structures and interfaces

    class Game {
        -Grid grid
        -int score
        -int high_score
        +start_new_game(size: int)
        +move(direction: str) bool
        +undo_last_move() bool
    }
    class Grid {
        -List~List~int~~ tiles
        +reset(size: int)
        +move_tiles(direction: str) bool
        +can_move() bool
        +get_empty_tiles() List~Tuple~int, int~~
    }
    class UI {
        +render(grid: Grid, score: int, high_score: int)
        +capture_input() str
    }
    class ScoreManager {
        -str file_path
        +load_high_score() int
        +save_high_score(score: int)
    }
    Game --> Grid
    Game --> UI
    Game --> ScoreManager

        end
        if undo requested
            G->>G: undo_last_move()
        end
    end


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification is needed on whether additional online functionalities such as leaderboards or a multiplayer mode are desired in future iterations.
